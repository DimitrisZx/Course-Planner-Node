# Course-Planner

This application was developed for my Bachelor Thesis "Anaylysis, Design and implementation of Web Application.

The brains of the app is a Node+ExressJS web server, which utilizes endpoints to communicate with an SPA built with React & Redux. The data is persisted in a Firestore Database.
The server handles the data transportation between the DB and the Front-End while it also implements a very barebones authentication system, which is one of the first system that must be improved.
